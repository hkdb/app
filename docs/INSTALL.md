## INSTALL

1. Make sure all the package managers you want app to manage are installed and configured properly
2. Install `git` manually if it's not already installed
3. cd into a directory of choice where you want to keep the app repo. If you are an end user and can't decide, I suggest `~/.config` (`mkdir ~/.config` if it doesn't already exist)
4. `git clone https://github.com/hkdb/app.git`
5. `cd app`
6. `./install.sh` or if you are running FreeBSD, run `bash install.sh`
